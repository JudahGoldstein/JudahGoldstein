I'm a second year Comp-Sec student at York University  
Working on building up this GitHub to something I can be a bit more proud of
---
**What I'm currently learning on my own time (not at university):**
- My main project at the moment is writing a companion suite for the TTRPG Delta Green consisting of an API (hosted by the GM) and web clients for the players.
- How to do more web automation tasks with script injection.
 
**Future project ideas:**
- My main area of interest is security, although at my proficiency  writing custom security software is outside my wheelhouse, but it's definitely something I'll be looking into in the future, maybe automating some of my workflow for CTFs and writing reports?
- Start automating more of my daily life, the deeper I delve into automation the more I realize I'm doing things that I could just automate.
- Get an app or two written, just for the experience.
- Write a machine learning project from scratch with no ML libraries.

**Some stuff I still want to learn:**
 - Reverse engineering malware.
 - Study for and get some security certs (studying for Sec+ at the moment, A+ already studied for, just need to actually take the test).
 - Learn a more advanced Metasploit workflow.
 - Making web extensions for Firefox/Vivaldi (Google killed Chromium ðŸ¥²).
 - I'd like to learn more database stuff outside of SQL and MongoDB. (update: my MongoDB skills are pretty good now, moving on to SQL)
 - Automating Linux tasks with Ansible.
