I'm a third year Comp-Sec student at York University  
Working on building up this GitHub to something I can be a bit more proud of
---
**What I'm currently learning on my own time (not at university):**
- My main project at the moment is writing a companion suite for the TTRPG Delta Green consisting of an API (hosted by the GM) and web clients for the players to centralize all the game data.
- Making NPC websites for Delta Green for ARG style games
- How to do more web automation tasks with script injection.
- Learning Toki Pona (ISO designation "tok") and developing a stenography system for the language. 

**Future project ideas:**
- My main area of interest is security, although at my proficiency  writing custom security software is outside my wheelhouse, but it's definitely something I'll be looking into in the future, maybe automating some of my workflow for CTFs and writing reports?
- Start automating more of my daily life, the deeper I delve into automation the more I realize I'm doing things that I could just automate.
- Get an app or two written, just for the experience.
- Write a machine learning project from scratch with no ML libraries.
- Learning 3D printing skills to use as part of my custom keyboard workflow (no matter how much I love low profile bare pcb designs).

**Some stuff I still want to learn:**
 - Reverse engineering malware.
 - Study for and get some security certs (studying for Sec+ at the moment, A+ already studied for, just need to actually take the test).
 - Learn a more advanced Metasploit workflow.
 - Making web extensions for Firefox/Vivaldi (Google killed Chromium ðŸ¥²).
 - I'd like to learn more database stuff outside of SQL and MongoDB.
 - Automating Linux tasks with Ansible.
