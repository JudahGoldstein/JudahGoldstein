I'm a fourth year Comp-Sec student at York University, Working on building up this GitHub to something I can be a bit more proud of
---
**What I'm currently learning on my own time (not at university):**
- ~~Developing an IaC system with ansible for home server use.~~ Decided to switch to Nix for an IaC project. 
- Learning Toki Pona (ISO designation "tok") and developing a stenography system for the language. 
- Do more capture the flag events. Trying to do one a week over the summer. 

**Future project ideas:**
- My main area of interest is security, although at my proficiency  writing custom security software is outside my wheelhouse, but it's definitely something I'll be looking into in the future, maybe automating some of my workflow for CTFs and writing reports?
- Start automating more of my daily life, the deeper I delve into automation the more I realize I'm doing things that I could just automate.
- ~~Get an app or two written, just for the experience.~~ Done for school, so can't publish here. 
- Write a machine learning project from scratch with no ML libraries.
- ~~Learning 3D printing skills to use as part of my custom keyboard workflow (no matter how much I love low profile bare pcb designs).~~ Bare PCBs for life. 

**Some stuff I still want to learn:**
 - Reverse engineering malware.
 - Study for and get some security certs (done studying for Sec+ at the moment, just need to actually take the test).
 - Learn a more advanced Metasploit workflow.
 - ~~Making web extensions for Firefox.~~ I've learned enough userscript to do anything I'd want to do with an extension. So taking this off. 
 - ~~I'd like to learn more database stuff outside of SQL and MongoDB.~~ Learned enough to know I don't like the alternatives, and I've soured a little on Mongo since adding it to this list. Don't see myself using it much anymore.
